Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a part of my micro-project journey with SkillCraft Technologies.
The aim of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, relationships, and insights from the data.

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in data science and machine learning to practice data cleaning, visualization, and analysis skills.

🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, such as:

Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

Passenger class (Pclass)

Name, Gender, Age

Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)

Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)

Ticket details, Fare, and Cabin

Port of embarkation (Embarked)

🛠 Skills & Tools Used

Python Libraries:

Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy – Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Core Skills:

Handling missing values

Detecting outliers

Data visualization for insights

Feature understanding and correlation analysis

📊 Key Insights

Some of the questions explored:

Which factors influenced passenger survival rates?

How survival correlated with gender, age, and class.

Distribution of passengers across embarkation ports.

Fare trends by class and survival status.
